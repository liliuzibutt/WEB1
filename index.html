  Grigori Rasputin (1869-1916) was a Russian mystic and confidant to the Romanov
family, particularly Tsarina Alexandra. Born in a Siberian peasant village,
Rasputin claimed to have healing abilities, which brought him to the attention
of the royal family. He became particularly influential after allegedly helping
to treat the hemophilia of Tsarevich Alexei, the heir to the throne.
Rasputin's close relationship with the Romanovs, along with his unconventional
behavior and perceived interference in political matters, made him a controversial
figure. Many in the Russian aristocracy and public saw him as a symbol of corruption
and the declining power of the Tsarist regime. In December 1916, a group of nobles
assassinated Rasputin, believing his death would save the monarchy. Despite his death,
the Russian Empire fell shortly afterward, leading to the Russian Revolution of 1917.</p>
